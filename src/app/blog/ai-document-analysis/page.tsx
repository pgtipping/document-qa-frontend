              The Evolution of Document Analysis
            </h2>
            <p>
              Traditional document analysis relied heavily on manual processes
              or basic optical character recognition (OCR) technology. These
              methods were time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in their
              ability to understand context and extract meaningful insights from
              documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introduction of artificial intelligence, particularly natural
              language processing (NLP) and machine learning, has revolutionized
              how we interact with and analyze documents. AI-powered document
              analysis systems can now:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Extract text from various document formats with high accuracy
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand document structure and relationships between
                different sections
              </li>
              <li>Identify key information and insights automatically</li>
              <li>Answer complex questions about document content</li>
              <li>
                Summarize lengthy documents while preserving critical
                information
              </li>
              <li>
                Analyze multiple documents simultaneously for comprehensive
                insights

              Large Language Models: The Game Changer
            </h2>
            <p>
              The development of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini,
              GPT-4, Deepseek, and Llama has been a game-changer for document
              analysis. These models possess several key capabilities that make
              them exceptionally well-suited for document processing:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> LLMs can understand
                the context of information within documents, recognizing
                relationships between different parts of text that might be
                separated by many pages.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Natural Language Interaction:</strong> Users can ask
                questions about documents in natural language, making the
                technology accessible to everyone, not just technical
                specialists.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cross-Document Analysis:</strong> Modern AI can analyze
                multiple documents simultaneously, drawing connections and
                insights across an entire corpus of information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multimodal Capabilities:</strong> Advanced models can
                process not just text, but also understand tables, charts,
                images, and other visual elements within documents.
              </li>

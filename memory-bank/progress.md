  - Configured `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule to ignore identifiers prefixed with `_`.
  - Fixed several ESLint errors (`no-unused-vars`, `no-explicit-any`, `no-namespace`) across multiple files.
- **Outcome:** Build still fails locally due to remaining ESLint errors and a persistent TypeScript type error (`ParamCheck<RouteContext>`). Vercel deployments remain blocked. Performance metrics require adaptation.

### In Progress - 2025-05-01 12:37:30 AM EDT

- Updating Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

### Next Steps - 2025-05-01 12:37:30 AM EDT

- Start a new task in Orchestrator mode to systematically address remaining build errors (ESLint, TypeScript) and adapt the performance metrics dashboard to the current architecture.

## 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT - Resolve Vercel Deployment Failures

### Completed - 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT

- **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosed persistent Vercel deployment failures caused by the `canvas` package's native dependency build requirements.
  - Attempted various methods to install system dependencies (`apt-get`, `yum`) via `vercel.json` commands, `apt.txt`, `build.sh`, and `package.json` `preinstall` scripts. These failed due to Vercel build environment limitations or incorrect execution order.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified that changing the Node.js version in Vercel settings to `20.x` (LTS) resolved the `canvas` installation error, likely by allowing the use of pre-compiled binaries.
  - Fixed subsequent build errors revealed by using Node 20.x:
    - Corrected ESLint configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` (removed invalid options).
    - Corrected TypeScript type error in `/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts` `DELETE` function signature.
- **Cleanup:** Removed unsuccessful configuration attempts (`preinstall` script from `package.json`, deleted `build.sh`, deleted `apt.txt`).
- **Process Improvement:** Decided to run `npm run build` locally after code changes to catch build errors before deployment attempts.

### In Progress - 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT

- Updating Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

### Next Steps - 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT

- Start a new task to run `npm run build` locally and address any errors.

# 2025-04-30 3:52:10 AM EDT - Implement Vector Similarity Search

### Completed - 2025-04-30 3:52:10 AM EDT

- **Feature:** Implemented vector similarity search using Pinecone and OpenAI embeddings to replace keyword-based context retrieval.
- **Technology Choices:**
  - Vector Database: Pinecone (Managed Service)
  - Embedding Model: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)
- **Dependencies:** Added `@pinecone-database/pinecone` and `openai` npm packages.
- **Configuration:**
  - Added `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` to `.env.example`.
  - User configured these variables in `.env.local`.
- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Created `src/lib/pinecone-client.ts` for Pinecone client initialization.
  - Added `generateEmbedding` function to `src/lib/llm-service.ts`.
  - Modified `/api/upload/route.ts`:
    - Extracts text content upon upload.
    - Splits content into chunks (`splitIntoChunks`).
    - Generates embedding for each chunk (`generateEmbedding`).
    - Upserts chunk text and embedding vector to Pinecone index in batches.
  - Modified `/api/ask/route.ts`:
    - Generates embedding for the user's question (`generateEmbedding`).
    - Queries Pinecone index using the question embedding and filters (user ID, optional document IDs).
    - Extracts text from Pinecone metadata to use as context for the LLM prompt.
    - Removed old keyword-based `getRelevantChunks` logic.
- **Debugging:** Resolved a 500 Internal Server Error during document deletion (`/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`) caused by an incorrect proxy rewrite rule in `next.config.mjs`.
- **Testing:**
  - Successfully deleted old documents via UI.
  - Successfully re-uploaded test documents (DOCX, PDF), observing embedding/upsert logs in the terminal.
  - Successfully tested question-answering, confirming relevant context retrieval via Pinecone vector search.

# 2025-04-29 5:31:11 PM EDT - Refactor Generate Question Button Behavior

### Completed - 2025-04-29 5:31:11 PM EDT

- **Refactoring:** Modified `document-qa-frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`.
- **Behavior Change:** The "Generate Question" button now fetches a suggested question from `/api/ask` (using `mode: "model"`) and populates the chat input field (`input` state) instead of submitting the question directly.
- **State Management:** Introduced a separate loading state (`isGeneratingQuestion`) for the generation action and removed the no-longer-needed `currentMode` state.
- **Simplification:** Simplified the main `handleSubmit` function to only handle user-submitted messages.
- **Memory Bank:** Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect these changes.

# 2025-04-28 23:58:10 EDT - File Upload Debugging (Hydration & Update Depth)

### Completed - 2025-04-28 23:58:10 EDT

- **Debugging:** Investigated file upload errors reported by the user (React hydration error, Maximum update depth exceeded) using console logs and screenshots.
- **Fixes:**
  - Wrapped `handleSelectionChange` in `useCallback` within `chat/page.tsx` to prevent unnecessary re-renders potentially causing the update depth error.
  - Refactored the rendering logic in `DocumentList.tsx` (using `write_to_file`) to simplify state management and potentially resolve the hydration mismatch. Removed a redundant `useEffect` hook.
  - Corrected a minor ESLint error introduced during the `DocumentList.tsx` rewrite.

# 2025-04-28 18:31:38 - Multi-Document Selection for Chat Context

### Completed - 2025-04-28 18:31:38

- **Frontend (`DocumentList.tsx`):** Implemented checkbox UI for document selection and added `onSelectionChange` prop to communicate selected IDs.
- **Frontend (`chat/page.tsx`):** Added state (`selectedDocumentIds`) to manage selections and passed the state/handler between `DocumentList` and `ChatInterface`.
- **Frontend (`ChatInterface.tsx`):** Updated component to accept `selectedDocumentIds` prop and include this array in the body of the `/api/ask` request.
- **Backend (`/api/ask/route.ts`):**
  - Modified route to read the optional `documentIds` array from the request body.
  - Updated Prisma query logic:
    - If `documentIds` is present and non-empty, fetch only those specific active documents belonging to the user.
    - If `documentIds` is absent or empty, fetch all active documents for the user (maintaining previous behavior).
  - Ensured subsequent document processing uses the correctly fetched set of S3 keys.
- **Fixes:** Resolved associated type errors and linting issues in all modified frontend and backend files.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28 18:31:38

- N/A (Feature complete)

## 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT - Architecture Confirmation & Linting Fixes

### Completed - 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT

- **Architecture Confirmation:** Reviewed `overhaul_plan.md` and confirmed the architectural decision to consolidate backend functionality within the Next.js application (`document-qa-frontend`), eliminating the separate Python backend.
- **PDF Extraction Strategy:** Confirmed that using the existing `pdf-ts` library within the Next.js backend (`src/lib/document-processing.ts`) is the correct approach for the MVP, aligning with the overhaul plan. Decided against exploring Puppeteer or migrating to Python.
- **Linting:** Fixed linting issues in `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` (removed unused code, added env var checks, improved error handling, defined constant). Retained LLM fallback logic for extraction per user instruction.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT

- Refining document processing within the Next.js backend.
- Continuing implementation according to `overhaul_plan.md`.

## 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00 - PDF Processing Update (Attempting pdf-ts)

### Completed - 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00

- **Analysis:** Reviewed current LLM fallback issues for PDF extraction in `document-qa-frontend`.
- **Research:** Explored Vercel AI SDK PDF capabilities and alternative TypeScript PDF parsing libraries (`pdf-parse`, `pdf-ts`).
- **Investigation:** Confirmed previous attempts to use `pdf-parse`/`pdfjs-dist` in `document-processing.ts` were unsuccessful (commented out code, error notes).
- **Decision:** Opted to try the `pdf-ts` library for direct PDF parsing within the Next.js frontend API routes.
- **Dependency:** Installed `pdf-ts` package in `document-qa-frontend`.
- **Implementation:** Modified `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to:
  - Import `pdfToText` from `pdf-ts`.
  - Replace the LLM-only fallback for PDFs with a call to `pdfToText`.
  - Keep existing LLM fallback logic for cases where `pdfToText` might fail or return insufficient content.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00

- Improving PDF text extraction reliability using a direct parsing library (`pdf-ts`).

### Next Steps - 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00

## 2025-04-28T02:48:45-04:00 - PDF Processing Enhancement

### Completed - 2025-04-28T02:48:45-04:00

- **Analysis:** Reviewed previous PDF processing attempts (`pdf-parse` failure, OCR-only method using `pdfjs-dist` + `Tesseract.js`).
- **Refactoring:** Modified `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to implement a hybrid PDF text extraction strategy:
  - Prioritizes direct text layer extraction (`pdfjs-dist`'s `getTextContent`).
  - Falls back to OCR (`pdfjs-dist` rendering + `Tesseract.js`) for image-based or low-text PDFs.
  - Retains LLM extraction as a final fallback.
- **Cleanup:** Resolved ESLint errors introduced during refactoring (type safety, unused imports).

### In Progress - 2025-04-28T02:48:45-04:00

- Improving document processing reliability.

### Next Steps - 2025-04-28T02:48:45-04:00

## 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00 - File Upload Debugging (ENOENT & EAUTH)

### Completed - 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00

- Investigated persistent `ENOENT` error during file upload, tracing it back to the import/initialization phase of `llm-service.ts` within `document-processing.ts`.
- Temporarily disabled the import and usage of `llm-service.ts` in `document-processing.ts` to isolate the `ENOENT` error. Confirmed this resolved the `ENOENT` issue.
- Identified `EAUTH` error in `/api/alerts` caused by failed email sending attempt (likely invalid credentials).
- Temporarily disabled email sending functionality in `/api/alerts/route.ts` by commenting out the relevant code block, resolving the `EAUTH` error.
- Addressed associated ESLint warnings in modified files (`document-processing.ts`, `alerts/route.ts`).

### In Progress - 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00

- File upload functionality debugging.

### Next Steps - 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00

- Restart the development server with the latest changes (LLM service import disabled, email alerts disabled).
- Test file upload again to confirm both `ENOENT` and `EAUTH` errors are gone.
- If upload succeeds, systematically re-enable the LLM service functionality in `document-processing.ts` and test Q&A.

## 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00 - NextAuth CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR Resolution

### Completed - 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00

- Diagnosed the `[next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR]` and associated `404` for `/api/auth/session`.
- Verified environment variables (`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`), API route handler (`[...nextauth]/route.ts`), `SessionProvider` setup (`Providers.tsx`, `layout.tsx`), and middleware (`middleware.ts`) were correctly configured.
- Identified the conflicting `rewrites` rule in `next.config.mjs` as the root cause, which was proxying `/api/auth/*` routes incorrectly.
- Modified the `rewrites` rule source to `"/api/((?!auth/).*)"` to exclude NextAuth routes from the proxy.
- Confirmed with the user that restarting the development server resolved the error.

### In Progress - 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00

- Debugging NextAuth integration issues.

### Next Steps - 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00

# 2025-05-09 10:00:00 - Fixed Vercel Dynamic Route Conflict ([fileId] vs [id])

## Completed - 2025-05-09 10:00:00

- **Task:** Resolve Vercel build error due to conflicting dynamic route slugs in Next.js App Router
- **Actions:**
  - Identified duplicate dynamic route segments: `[fileId]` and `[id]` under `/api/files/`
  - Standardized all dynamic segments to `[fileId]` for file/document APIs
  - Renamed `/api/files/[id]/search/route.ts` to `/api/files/[fileId]/search/route.ts` and updated all parameter references
  - Deleted the old `[id]` folder and verified no lingering references
  - Successfully ran `npm run build` with no dynamic route errors

## Technical Notes - 2025-05-09 10:00:00

- **Next.js Restriction:** Only one dynamic segment name is allowed per path level; mixing `[id]` and `[fileId]` causes build failure
- **Refactor:** All API and import references now use `fileId` for clarity and consistency
- **Build:** Project builds cleanly; warnings are unrelated to dynamic routing

## Next Steps - 2025-05-09 10:00:00

1. **QA & Regression:**
   - Test all file/document API endpoints for regressions
   - Run E2E and integration tests for document search and deletion
2. **Documentation:**
   - Update developer docs to clarify dynamic route naming conventions
   - Add a note in onboarding docs about Next.js dynamic route restrictions
3. **CI/CD:**
   - Monitor next Vercel deployment for successful build and runtime
   - Add a regression test for dynamic route conflicts in future PRs

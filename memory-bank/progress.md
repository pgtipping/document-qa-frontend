    - `/document-qa-frontend/cypress` directory had structure but lacked implementation
  - Consolidated all Cypress-related files into the correct project location:
    - Moved E2E test files: `auth-flows.cy.ts`, `quiz-flow.cy.ts`, `quiz-sharing.cy.ts`
    - Copied fixture files: `documents.json`, `users.json`, `quizzes.json`
    - Copied support files: `commands.ts`, `e2e.ts`
    - Used existing JavaScript-based Cypress configuration (`cypress.config.js`)
  - Cleaned up project structure by removing redundant root `/cypress` directory
  - Verified consolidated setup works correctly:
    - Successfully ran `npx cypress verify` in the frontend directory
    - Confirmed Cypress could open and detect the properly organized tests

## Technical Notes - 2025-05-04 00:55:41

- **Project Organization:** Test files should always reside within their respective project directories to maintain proper module imports and configuration
- **Configuration Approach:** JavaScript-based Cypress configuration (`cypress.config.js`) avoids TypeScript type definition issues encountered previously
- **TypeScript Integration:** TypeScript support for Cypress is maintained through:
  - Properly configured `cypress/tsconfig.json` with correct type references
  - Type declarations in `commands.ts` for custom Cypress commands
  - Testing library integration with `@testing-library/cypress/add-commands`

    - Converted `cypress.config.ts` to JavaScript-based `cypress.config.js` to sidestep type declaration issues
    - Configured `cypress/tsconfig.json` with proper type references for Cypress, Node and Testing Library
    - Installed additional packages: `@testing-library/cypress`, `@types/cypress`, `@types/node`
    - Added module resolution settings and proper type configuration
  - Verified the solution:
    - Successfully ran `npx cypress verify` to confirm installation
    - Ensured Cypress tests could still run with JS-based configuration
    - Preserved all existing E2E test functionality

## Outcome:

- Successfully resolved all TypeScript linter errors related to Cypress configuration

## 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT - Resolve Vercel Deployment Failures

### Completed - 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT

- **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosed persistent Vercel deployment failures caused by the `canvas` package's native dependency build requirements.
  - Attempted various methods to install system dependencies (`apt-get`, `yum`) via `vercel.json` commands, `apt.txt`, `build.sh`, and `package.json` `preinstall` scripts. These failed due to Vercel build environment limitations or incorrect execution order.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified that changing the Node.js version in Vercel settings to `20.x` (LTS) resolved the `canvas` installation error, likely by allowing the use of pre-compiled binaries.
  - Fixed subsequent build errors revealed by using Node 20.x:
    - Corrected ESLint configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` (removed invalid options).
    - Corrected TypeScript type error in `/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts` `DELETE` function signature.
- **Cleanup:** Removed unsuccessful configuration attempts (`preinstall` script from `package.json`, deleted `build.sh`, deleted `apt.txt`).
- **Process Improvement:** Decided to run `npm run build` locally after code changes to catch build errors before deployment attempts.

### In Progress - 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT

- Updating Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

### Next Steps - 2025-04-30 6:06:43 PM EDT

- Start a new task to run `npm run build` locally and address any errors.

  - Vector Database: Pinecone (Managed Service)
  - Embedding Model: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)
- **Dependencies:** Added `@pinecone-database/pinecone` and `openai` npm packages.
- **Configuration:**
  - Added `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` to `.env.example`.
  - User configured these variables in `.env.local`.
- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Created `src/lib/pinecone-client.ts` for Pinecone client initialization.
  - Added `generateEmbedding` function to `src/lib/llm-service.ts`.
  - Modified `/api/upload/route.ts`:
    - Extracts text content upon upload.
    - Splits content into chunks (`splitIntoChunks`).
    - Generates embedding for each chunk (`generateEmbedding`).
    - Upserts chunk text and embedding vector to Pinecone index in batches.
  - Modified `/api/ask/route.ts`:
    - Generates embedding for the user's question (`generateEmbedding`).
    - Queries Pinecone index using the question embedding and filters (user ID, optional document IDs).
    - Extracts text from Pinecone metadata to use as context for the LLM prompt.
    - Removed old keyword-based `getRelevantChunks` logic.
- **Debugging:** Resolved a 500 Internal Server Error during document deletion (`/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`) caused by an incorrect proxy rewrite rule in `next.config.mjs`.
- **Testing:**
  - Successfully deleted old documents via UI.
  - Successfully re-uploaded test documents (DOCX, PDF), observing embedding/upsert logs in the terminal.

# 2025-04-29 5:31:11 PM EDT - Refactor Generate Question Button Behavior

### Completed - 2025-04-29 5:31:11 PM EDT

- **Refactoring:** Modified `document-qa-frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`.
- **Behavior Change:** The "Generate Question" button now fetches a suggested question from `/api/ask` (using `mode: "model"`) and populates the chat input field (`input` state) instead of submitting the question directly.
- **State Management:** Introduced a separate loading state (`isGeneratingQuestion`) for the generation action and removed the no-longer-needed `currentMode` state.
- **Simplification:** Simplified the main `handleSubmit` function to only handle user-submitted messages.

# 2025-04-28 23:58:10 EDT - File Upload Debugging (Hydration & Update Depth)

### Completed - 2025-04-28 23:58:10 EDT

- **Debugging:** Investigated file upload errors reported by the user (React hydration error, Maximum update depth exceeded) using console logs and screenshots.
- **Fixes:**
  - Wrapped `handleSelectionChange` in `useCallback` within `chat/page.tsx` to prevent unnecessary re-renders potentially causing the update depth error.
  - Refactored the rendering logic in `DocumentList.tsx` (using `write_to_file`) to simplify state management and potentially resolve the hydration mismatch. Removed a redundant `useEffect` hook.
  - Corrected a minor ESLint error introduced during the `DocumentList.tsx` rewrite.
- **Verification:** Confirmed with the user via manual testing that file uploads are now successful and the previously observed console errors are no longer present.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28 23:58:10 EDT

- N/A (Issue Resolved)

### Next Steps - 2025-04-28 23:58:10 EDT

# 2025-04-28 18:31:38 - Multi-Document Selection for Chat Context

### Completed - 2025-04-28 18:31:38

- **Frontend (`DocumentList.tsx`):** Implemented checkbox UI for document selection and added `onSelectionChange` prop to communicate selected IDs.
- **Frontend (`chat/page.tsx`):** Added state (`selectedDocumentIds`) to manage selections and passed the state/handler between `DocumentList` and `ChatInterface`.
- **Frontend (`ChatInterface.tsx`):** Updated component to accept `selectedDocumentIds` prop and include this array in the body of the `/api/ask` request.
- **Backend (`/api/ask/route.ts`):**
  - Modified route to read the optional `documentIds` array from the request body.
  - Updated Prisma query logic:
    - If `documentIds` is present and non-empty, fetch only those specific active documents belonging to the user.
    - If `documentIds` is absent or empty, fetch all active documents for the user (maintaining previous behavior).
  - Ensured subsequent document processing uses the correctly fetched set of S3 keys.
- **Fixes:** Resolved associated type errors and linting issues in all modified frontend and backend files.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28 18:31:38

- N/A (Feature complete)

## 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT - Architecture Confirmation & Linting Fixes

### Completed - 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT

- **Architecture Confirmation:** Reviewed `overhaul_plan.md` and confirmed the architectural decision to consolidate backend functionality within the Next.js application (`document-qa-frontend`), eliminating the separate Python backend.
- **PDF Extraction Strategy:** Confirmed that using the existing `pdf-ts` library within the Next.js backend (`src/lib/document-processing.ts`) is the correct approach for the MVP, aligning with the overhaul plan. Decided against exploring Puppeteer or migrating to Python.
- **Linting:** Fixed linting issues in `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` (removed unused code, added env var checks, improved error handling, defined constant). Retained LLM fallback logic for extraction per user instruction.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT

- Refining document processing within the Next.js backend.
- Continuing implementation according to `overhaul_plan.md`.

## 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00 - PDF Processing Update (Attempting pdf-ts)

### Completed - 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00

- **Analysis:** Reviewed current LLM fallback issues for PDF extraction in `document-qa-frontend`.
- **Research:** Explored Vercel AI SDK PDF capabilities and alternative TypeScript PDF parsing libraries (`pdf-parse`, `pdf-ts`).
- **Investigation:** Confirmed previous attempts to use `pdf-parse`/`pdfjs-dist` in `document-processing.ts` were unsuccessful (commented out code, error notes).
- **Decision:** Opted to try the `pdf-ts` library for direct PDF parsing within the Next.js frontend API routes.
- **Dependency:** Installed `pdf-ts` package in `document-qa-frontend`.
- **Implementation:** Modified `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to:
  - Import `pdfToText` from `pdf-ts`.
  - Replace the LLM-only fallback for PDFs with a call to `pdfToText`.
  - Keep existing LLM fallback logic for cases where `pdfToText` might fail or return insufficient content.

### In Progress - 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00

- Improving PDF text extraction reliability using a direct parsing library (`pdf-ts`).

### Next Steps - 2025-04-28T05:29:30-04:00

- **Analysis:** Reviewed previous PDF processing attempts (`pdf-parse` failure, OCR-only method using `pdfjs-dist` + `Tesseract.js`).
- **Refactoring:** Modified `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to implement a hybrid PDF text extraction strategy:
  - Prioritizes direct text layer extraction (`pdfjs-dist`'s `getTextContent`).
  - Falls back to OCR (`pdfjs-dist` rendering + `Tesseract.js`) for image-based or low-text PDFs.
  - Retains LLM extraction as a final fallback.
- **Cleanup:** Resolved ESLint errors introduced during refactoring (type safety, unused imports).

### In Progress - 2025-04-28T02:48:45-04:00

- Improving document processing reliability.

## 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00 - File Upload Debugging (ENOENT & EAUTH)

### Completed - 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00

- Investigated persistent `ENOENT` error during file upload, tracing it back to the import/initialization phase of `llm-service.ts` within `document-processing.ts`.
- Temporarily disabled the import and usage of `llm-service.ts` in `document-processing.ts` to isolate the `ENOENT` error. Confirmed this resolved the `ENOENT` issue.
- Identified `EAUTH` error in `/api/alerts` caused by failed email sending attempt (likely invalid credentials).
- Temporarily disabled email sending functionality in `/api/alerts/route.ts` by commenting out the relevant code block, resolving the `EAUTH` error.
- Addressed associated ESLint warnings in modified files (`document-processing.ts`, `alerts/route.ts`).

### In Progress - 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00

- File upload functionality debugging.

### Next Steps - 2025-04-27T05:50:39-04:00

## 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00 - NextAuth CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR Resolution

### Completed - 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00

- Diagnosed the `[next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR]` and associated `404` for `/api/auth/session`.
- Verified environment variables (`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`), API route handler (`[...nextauth]/route.ts`), `SessionProvider` setup (`Providers.tsx`, `layout.tsx`), and middleware (`middleware.ts`) were correctly configured.
- Identified the conflicting `rewrites` rule in `next.config.mjs` as the root cause, which was proxying `/api/auth/*` routes incorrectly.
- Modified the `rewrites` rule source to `"/api/((?!auth/).*)"` to exclude NextAuth routes from the proxy.
- Confirmed with the user that restarting the development server resolved the error.

### In Progress - 2025-04-26T23:37:27-04:00

- Debugging NextAuth integration issues.

1. **Setup the test database:**

   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma client and run migrations
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate deploy

   # Seed the test database
   npm run seed:test
   ```

2. **Verify database setup:**

   ```bash
   # Verify the database tables exist
   npx prisma db pull
   ```

3. **Run a single test to verify database connection:**

   ```bash
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev

   # In another terminal, run a single test
   npm run cy:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/auth-flows.cy.ts"

## Implementation Instructions - 2025-05-06 16:32:05

To continue the E2E testing implementation, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **First, check and update quiz fixtures:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the fixtures directory
   cd document-qa-frontend/cypress/fixtures

   # Examine quizzes.json to ensure it contains expected test data
   cat quizzes.json

   # If quiz-1 is missing, edit the file to add it
   # with structure matching what tests expect:
   # {
   #   "id": "quiz-1",
   #   "title": "Test Quiz 1",
   #   "questions": [...],
   #   ...
   # }
   ```

2. **Build the application with updated components:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate back to the frontend directory
   cd document-qa-frontend

   # Build the application
   npm run build

   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the updated components:**

   ```bash
   # In a new terminal, run Cypress tests with visual feedback
   npm run cy:open -- --spec "cypress/e2e/quiz-flow.cy.ts"
   ```

4. **Use Cypress Developer Tools to debug:**

   - When tests run, use the Element Inspector to verify data-testid attributes
   - Check the actual DOM structure against what tests expect
   - Note any mismatches between selectors and actual elements

5. **Update quiz-flow.cy.ts tests:**

   ```bash
   # Open the test file
   code cypress/e2e/quiz-flow.cy.ts

   # Update selectors to use data-testid attributes first with fallbacks:
   # Example:
   # cy.get('[data-testid="quiz-display"]').should('be.visible')
   ```

6. **Create or update Cypress commands:**

   ```bash
   # Open commands file
   code cypress/support/commands.ts

   # Add helper functions for quiz interactions:
   # Example:
   # Cypress.Commands.add('selectQuizOption', (questionIndex, optionIndex) => {
   #   cy.get(`[data-testid="option-${optionIndex}"]`).click()
   # })
   ```

7. **Document the testing approach:**

   ```bash
   # Create or update testing documentation
   code __tests__/README.md

   # Add section on data-testid pattern
   # Document fixture requirements
   # Add troubleshooting guide
   ```

## Testing Process - 2025-05-06 16:32:05

Follow this process to ensure test reliability:

1. **Check fixtures first** - Tests will fail if fixtures don't match expectations
2. **Run tests one at a time** - Focus on fixing one test case before moving to the next
3. **Use visual mode** - Cypress open mode helps identify selector issues
4. **Add logging** - Add cy.log() statements to debug test flow
5. **Check timing issues** - Add proper waitFor assertions before interactions
6. **Verify component updates** - Make sure the application is using the updated components

## Resumption Guidance - 2025-05-06 16:32:05

When returning to this work, follow these steps in order:

1. **Review current progress in Memory Bank**
2. **Check fixture data** in cypress/fixtures/quizzes.json
3. **Run failing tests** with cypress open to identify specific issues

# 2025-06-10 14:30:00 - E2E Testing Progress Update

## Test Infrastructure Improvements - 2025-06-10 14:30:00

### Fixed Issues:

- ✅ Updated auth.ts with debug configuration `debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`
- ✅ Enhanced Cypress e2e.ts with comprehensive error handling for NextAuth errors
- ✅ Fixed the QuizDisplay component's CountdownTimer props (changed 'seconds' to 'initialSeconds' and 'onWarning' to 'onWarningThreshold')
- ✅ Updated Cypress configuration to use seed-test-db.js instead of seed-test-db.ts
- ✅ Authentication tests (auth-flows.cy.ts) now pass successfully

### Remaining Issues:

- ❌ Quiz flow tests still failing
  - The quiz creation page appears to be in a perpetual loading state
  - UI elements that tests are looking for (e.g., document-select, quiz-title) don't exist in the DOM
  - Test fixtures may not match what the components expect

### Next Steps:

1. **Investigate Quiz Creation Page:**

   - Debug the loading state on the quiz creation page
   - Check if the document list API call is working correctly

2. **Verify Test Fixtures:**

   - Ensure quiz fixtures in cypress/fixtures/quizzes.json match component expectations
   - Check if the API mocks are correctly intercepting requests

3. **Update Test Selectors:**

   - Verify that all quiz-related components have proper data-testid attributes
   - Update quiz-flow.cy.ts to use more resilient selector patterns

4. **Run Tests in Visual Mode:**
   - Use `npm run cy:open` to debug tests interactively
   - Examine DOM structure during test runs to identify missing elements

## Implementation Notes - 2025-06-10 14:30:00

- The server port configuration was updated from 3004 to 3005 to avoid port conflicts
- Both .env.test and cypress.config.ts were updated to use the new port
- The QuizDisplay component had type errors related to the CountdownTimer props
- The auth-flows.cy.ts tests now run successfully, confirming our auth.ts fixes are working

## Root Cause Analysis - 2025-06-10 14:30:00

The main issue preventing the tests from passing appears to be related to:

1. **Component Loading State:** The quiz creation page gets stuck in loading, suggesting API mocks may not be intercepting properly
2. **Missing DOM Elements:** The tests expect specific elements that aren't in the DOM, either due to loading issues or component changes
3. **Fixture/Component Mismatch:** There may be discrepancies between test fixtures and component expectations

Further investigation is needed to resolve these issues and get all E2E tests passing.

# E2E Testing Progress - 2025-05-06 19:22:17

## Custom Cypress Commands Implementation - 2025-05-06 19:22:17

- **Resilient Selector Strategy:**

  - Implemented fallback patterns for all selector operations:
    - Primary: Always try data-testid selectors first
    - Secondary: Fall back to class-based selectors if data-testid not found
    - Tertiary: Use element types as last resort
  - Added detailed logging for debugging selector failures
  - Created helper commands to encapsulate common operations with built-in resilience

- **Command Implementation Details:**
  - `selectQuizOption`: Selects options in multiple-choice or true/false questions
    ```typescript
    cy.selectQuizOption(questionIndex, optionIndex); // First question, second option
    ```
  - `answerQuestion`: Handles text input for short answer questions
    ```typescript
    cy.answerQuestion(questionIndex, "answer text");
    ```
  - `navigateQuiz`: Handles quiz navigation with direction parameter
    ```typescript
    cy.navigateQuiz("next"); // Options: "next", "prev", "submit"
    ```
  - `waitForQuizLoad`: Ensures quiz is fully loaded before proceeding
    ```typescript
    cy.waitForQuizLoad(); // Waits for loading state to disappear
    ```

  - ❌ "should display quiz questions and allow answering" - Loading state issues
  - ❌ "should display quiz results" - Missing data-testid attributes

## Root Causes Identified - 2025-05-06 19:22:17

1. **Port Configuration Mismatch:**

   - Next.js server running on port 3004 but Cypress configured for 3005
   - Fixed by updating cypress.config.ts and run-e2e-tests.sh

2. **Missing Component Selectors:**

   - Data-testid attributes referenced in tests not found in components
   - Need to verify components are rendered with correct attributes

3. **API Interception Issues:**

   - Mock implementations for document list and quiz generation may be incorrect
   - Need to verify API paths and response formats

4. **Test Fixture Problems:**
   - Quiz-1 and test-quiz-1 may be missing or incorrectly structured in fixtures
   - Need to verify fixture data matches component expectations

## Next Steps - 2025-05-06 19:22:17

1. **Debug Ongoing Test Failures:**

   ```bash
   # Run with visual feedback for debugging
   npm run cy:open -- --spec "cypress/e2e/quiz-flow.cy.ts"

   # Or run with detailed logging
   npm run test:quiz
   ```

2. **Fix Component Selector Issues:**

   - Update document selection component with proper data-testid attributes
   - Add consistent selectors to quiz generation form
   - Ensure all quiz components have proper data-testid attributes

3. **Verify Test Fixtures:**

   ```bash
   # Check structure of quiz fixtures
   cat cypress/fixtures/quizzes.json

   # Ensure proper formatting and existence of referenced quiz IDs
   ```

4. **Debug API Mocks:**

   - Use Cypress open mode to monitor network requests
   - Verify that intercepted API calls match actual application behavior
   - Update mock implementations if necessary

5. **Implement Incremental Test Fixes:**
   - Focus on fixing one test at a time
   - Run specific tests in isolation before running the full suite
   - Use test monitoring tools to track progress

## Implementation Direction - 2025-05-06 19:22:17

To effectively fix the E2E tests, we'll focus on specific issues in order of priority:

1. **First Priority: Fix "should allow creating a new quiz" test**

   - This is the simplest test and the foundation for others

## Status Update - 2025-05-08 00:58:56

- **Duplicate Route Warnings:** All duplicate route files were removed and the .next build cache was cleared, resolving all duplicate page warnings.
- **Registration 500 Error:** Root cause identified as missing tables in the production database (no `User` table). This was confirmed by Vercel logs.
- **Automated Production Migration:** Updated `package.json` to run `prisma migrate deploy` automatically after every build, ensuring production DB schema is always up to date with code.

## Next Steps - 2025-05-08 00:58:56

1. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   - Commit the updated `package.json` and push to main to trigger a new Vercel deployment.
2. **Verify Production Migration:**
   - After deployment, confirm that the `User` table and all required tables exist in the production database.
   - Test registration on production to ensure it works.
3. **Monitor for Errors:**
   - Check Vercel deployment logs for any migration or runtime errors.
   - If registration or other DB features fail, review logs and DB schema for discrepancies.
4. **Document and Communicate:**
   - Update onboarding and developer docs to clarify that DB migrations are now automated on every deployment.
   - Note: All future schema changes will be applied automatically in production.

- **Task:** Investigate and fix underlying ESLint and TypeScript build errors.
- **Completed:**
  - Removed error suppression from `next.config.mjs` and `@ts-ignore` from `/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`.
  - Updated ESLint packages (`eslint`, `eslint-config-next`) and installed required plugins (`@next/eslint-plugin-next`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`).
  - Refined `eslint.config.mjs` to use flat config format correctly, resolving initial configuration errors ("Invalid Options", "whitespace").
  - Configured `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule to ignore identifiers prefixed with `_`.
  - Fixed several ESLint errors (`no-unused-vars`, `no-explicit-any`, `no-namespace`) in various files (`admin/login/page.tsx`, `api/files/route.ts`, `api/models/route.ts`, `api/sentry-example-api/route.ts`, `app/page.tsx`, `test-email/page.tsx`).
- **Current Status:** Build still fails locally due to remaining ESLint errors (mostly `no-unused-vars`, `no-explicit-any`) and the persistent TypeScript type error (`ParamCheck<RouteContext>`) in `/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`. Vercel deployments remain blocked. Performance metrics need adaptation.

# Active Context - 2025-04-30 6:04:43 PM EDT

- **Task:** Resolve Vercel deployment failures related to the `canvas` package and subsequent build errors.
- **Completed:**
  - Attempted multiple strategies to install `canvas` system dependencies on Vercel:
    - Modifying `vercel.json` `installCommand` with `apt-get`. (Failed: `apt-get` not found)
    - Using `apt.txt`. (Failed: Dependencies not installed)
    - Using `build.sh` with `apt-get`. (Failed: `apt-get` not found in script context)
    - Using `build.sh` with `yum`. (Failed: Script not executed correctly by Vercel)
    - Using `preinstall` script in `package.json` with `yum`. (Failed: Dependencies not installed before `canvas` build)
  - Identified that `canvas` is a direct dependency and also required by `jest-environment-jsdom`.
  - Changed Node.js version in Vercel settings to `20.x` (LTS). This resolved the `canvas` installation issue by likely using pre-compiled binaries.
  - New deployment with Node 20.x revealed build-time errors:
    - ESLint configuration error (`useEslintrc`, `extensions` options invalid).
    - TypeScript type error in `/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts` `DELETE` function signature.
  - Fixed ESLint configuration in `eslint.config.mjs`.
  - Fixed TypeScript error in `/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`.
  - Removed unsuccessful dependency installation attempts (`preinstall` script, `build.sh`, `apt.txt`).
- **Decision:** Adopt the practice of running `npm run build` locally after changes to catch build errors before deploying to Vercel.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Update `progress.md`.
  - Start a new task to run `npm run build` locally in `document-qa-frontend` and fix any reported errors.

    - Fetch specific documents using provided IDs if available, ensuring they belong to the user and are active.
    - Fallback to fetching all user's active documents if no specific IDs are provided.
    - Use the correct set of S3 keys for content processing.
  - Resolved associated type and linting errors in modified files.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Thoroughly test the multi-document selection feature and `/api/ask` endpoint (no selection, single, multiple).
  - Test core document processing (`pdf-ts`, `mammoth`, plain text) with diverse file types.
  - Add comprehensive automated tests (session management, auth, Q&A mode, multi-file management, APIs).
  - Implement the "How to Use" guide page.

## Active Context - 2025-04-28 10:45:10 EDT

- **Task:** Refine document processing implementation within Next.js backend.
- **Completed:**
  - Confirmed architectural direction via `overhaul_plan.md`: All backend processing, including document extraction, should reside within the Next.js application (`document-qa-frontend`), eliminating the separate Python backend.
  - Verified that the current implementation uses `pdf-ts` in `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts`, aligning with the plan for the MVP.
  - Refactored `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to fix linting issues: removed unused code/imports, added environment variable checks, improved error handling, and defined a constant for the minimum character threshold. (Note: LLM fallback for extraction was _not_ removed per user instruction).
- **Next Steps:**
  - Continue implementing features outlined in `overhaul_plan.md`, focusing on:
    - Comprehensive testing of the current document processing (`pdf-ts`, `mammoth`, plain text) with various file types.
    - Implementing remaining multi-file management UI refinements (e.g., document selection influencing chat context if needed beyond just fetching all active documents).
    - Adding comprehensive tests for session management, authorization, Q&A mode, multi-file management, and related API interactions.
    - Implementing the "How to Use" guide page.

- **Task:** Improve PDF text extraction reliability and efficiency.
- **Completed:**
  - Analyzed current LLM fallback issues (slowness, errors) in `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts`.
  - Explored Vercel AI SDK PDF handling (relies on LLM).
  - Investigated TypeScript PDF parsing libraries (`pdf-parse`, `pdf-ts`).
  - Identified previous attempts and errors with `pdf-parse` and `pdfjs-dist` in the codebase.
  - Installed `pdf-ts` library in `document-qa-frontend`.
  - Updated `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to use `pdf-ts` (via `pdfToText` named import) for direct PDF text extraction, replacing the previous LLM-only approach for PDFs.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Test the updated PDF processing with `pdf-ts` using various PDF types (native text, scanned images, mixed).
  - If `pdf-ts` proves unreliable or insufficient, consider switching to `pdf-parse` or reverting to the Python backend approach.
  - Update `progress.md` to reflect these changes.

- **Task:** Improve PDF text extraction reliability and efficiency.
- **Completed:**
  - Analyzed previous PDF processing failures (OCR-only approach using `pdfjs-dist` + `Tesseract.js`).
  - Refactored PDF extraction in `document-qa-frontend/src/lib/document-processing.ts` to use a hybrid approach:
    - First attempts direct text layer extraction via `pdfjs-dist` (`page.getTextContent()`).
    - Falls back to OCR (`pdfjs-dist` rendering + `Tesseract.js`) if text layer yields insufficient content.
    - Retains LLM extraction as a final fallback.
  - Resolved associated ESLint errors (type safety, unused imports).
- **Next Steps:**
  - Test the updated PDF processing with various PDF types (native text, scanned images, mixed).
  - Update `progress.md` to reflect these changes.

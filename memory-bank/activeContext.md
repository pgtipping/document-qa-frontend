## Status Update - 2025-05-09 10:00:00

- **Current Focus:** Fix Vercel deployment error due to dynamic route slug conflict
- **Completed:**
  - Identified and resolved conflict between `[fileId]` and `[id]` dynamic segments in `/api/files/`
  - Standardized all dynamic segments to `[fileId]` for file/document APIs
  - Migrated and refactored all code and API references
  - Deleted old `[id]` folder and verified no lingering references
  - Build passes locally with no dynamic route errors

## Next Steps - 2025-05-09 10:00:00

1. **QA & Regression:**
   - Test all file/document API endpoints for regressions
   - Run E2E and integration tests for document search and deletion
2. **Documentation:**
   - Update developer docs to clarify dynamic route naming conventions
   - Add a note in onboarding docs about Next.js dynamic route restrictions
3. **CI/CD:**
   - Monitor next Vercel deployment for successful build and runtime
   - Add a regression test for dynamic route conflicts in future PRs

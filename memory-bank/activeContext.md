## Clear Resumption Instructions - 2025-05-06 03:31:18 EDT

To resume E2E testing work in the next session, follow these specific steps:

1. **Fix NextAuth Configuration First:**

   ```bash
   # First check if NextAuth works when running normally
   npm run dev

   # Navigate to the login page to verify
   # If working, proceed to fix test configuration
   ```

2. **Update Auth Type Definitions:**

   - Review NextAuth.js documentation for correct options
   - Check if we're using an older version with different config options
   - Update the auth.ts file with proper type-safe configuration

3. **Run Seed Script Independently:**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/seed-test-db.ts
   ```

   - Check for specific errors in model access or relationships
   - If errors occur, review Prisma schema again

4. **Run Tests With Modified Configuration:**

   ```bash
   # Run auth tests specifically
   npm run cy:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/auth-flows.cy.ts"
   ```

   - Note any specific NextAuth errors
   - Check for URL construction failures

5. **If Tests Still Fail:**
   - Create an auth-bypass middleware for testing
   - Add direct API testing method
   - Consider mocking NextAuth for initial tests

## Next Steps - 2025-05-06 03:31:18 EDT

1. **Authentication Test Bypass:**

   - Create a test-only middleware to bypass auth checks in testing
   - Implement testing strategy that doesn't require full auth flow
   - Consider direct API testing as alternative

2. **UI Component Testing:**

   - Enhance component test coverage alongside E2E tests
   - Create dedicated mocks for NextAuth provider
   - Focus on isolated component testing with msw

3. **Database Reliability:**
   - Improve database reset between tests
   - Add validation steps to ensure clean state
   - Consider transaction-based test isolation

## E2E Testing Implementation Strategy - 2025-05-06 04:26:49

### Current Status - 2025-05-06 04:26:49

- Authentication E2E tests are now partially working
- Fixed URL validation error handling in Cypress
- Quiz flow tests are still failing due to:
  - Missing fixture data
  - Outdated selectors
  - Database seeding issues

### Immediate Next Steps - 2025-05-06 04:26:49

1. **Auth.ts Configuration Updates:**

   - Fix debug settings: `debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`
   - Update cookie configuration to be environment-aware
   - Add comprehensive error handling for URL validation issues

2. **Quiz Component Updates:**

   - Add data-testid attributes to all quiz components:
     - QuizDisplay.tsx
     - QuizResults.tsx
     - QuizQuestion.tsx
   - Update selectors in test files to use data-testid

3. **Database Seeding Improvements:**

   - Convert seed script from ES modules to CommonJS for better compatibility
   - Add proper cleanup and validation to seed-test-db.ts
   - Create transaction-based seeding for atomic operations

4. **Cypress Support Files:**
   - Enhance e2e.ts to handle additional auth-related errors
   - Update commands.ts to better handle login simulation
   - Add consistent test selectors and utilities

### Technical Approach - 2025-05-06 04:26:49

1. **URL Validation Fixes:**

   - Update cookie configuration in auth.ts to fix the "Failed to construct 'URL'" error
   - Use more flexible assertions in tests that don't depend on exact URLs
   - Add global exception handling for specific NextAuth errors

2. **Test Selectors Strategy:**

   - Add data-testid attributes to all key UI components following the pattern: `data-testid="component-name-action"`
   - Update quiz components with proper test hooks
   - Remove class-based selectors in favor of data attributes

3. **Enhanced Test Setup:**
   - Revise setup-test-env.sh to be more robust
   - Add port availability checking before starting server
   - Implement proper database cleanup and seeding
   - Create atomic test runs with proper isolation

The detailed implementation plan has been documented in TESTING_SETUP.md for reference.
